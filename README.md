# Codenames

This is a simple multiplayer game where you uncover cryptic agents names in two teams. It is based on real game called Codenames. My digital version offers a game board with random words each game, 3 player teams: rose, indigo, spectators and a global chat for communication and game notifications. Website is designed to work on desktops as well as mobile.

The game was build using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework for front-end and simple [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) server for back-end. It uses WebSockets for quick and synchronous communication between players. [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS framework was used for easy front-end layouts.

## List of potential additions

* Turn based system (blocking and enabling players to flip the cards depending on current state)
* Time limiting (each team have set time for making a turn, adjustable timer would end turn when it hits zero)
* Session system (after exiting the game by closing the tab or refreshing the page player would still connect to the game without a need for code typing)
* Multiple word sets / language versions as a room setting
